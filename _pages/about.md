I am a postdoctoral researcher in the field of climate science. After starting my PhD at Institute of Tibetan Plateau Researchï¼ŒChinese Academy of Sciences, in 2013, I spent two years (2017-2019) as a visiting scholar at Brown University in the USA and graduated in 2019. In 2020, I began my postdoctoral research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, and in 2023, I joined Polar Terrestrial Environmental Systems section of Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Germany for postdoctoral researcher. 

My research primarily focuses on using biomarkers to study climate and environmental changes and their impacts on lake ecosystems and human societies. Currently, I am integrating ancient DNA with biomarkers to explore the relationship between ecosystem diversity and biomarkers.
